/**
 * Provides pluggable look-and-feel for SwingX components together with a
 * mechanism to support custom component look-and-feels.
 * <p>
 * The addons are loaded with {@link java.util.ServiceLoader}.  As such we 
 * maintain, a services file for our implementations.  SwingX uses the 
 * <a href="http://metainf-services.kohsuke.org/">MetaInf/services</a>
 * generator API. This add a compile time dependency to the plaf module.
 * The services generator, however, is not required at runtime.
