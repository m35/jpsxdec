Important TODO
==============

Presentation sector RANGE
    Background
Video frames maintain the last sector number that contained frame data.
This sector is then (usually) used to determine the timing when a frame
should appear, called the "presentation sector".
    Issue
Often there are small gaps between video frames.
The last sector of a vide frame doesn't have to be the presentation sector
It could land anywhere within that gab.
If a video frame ends early, its presentation sector will be off
leading to warnings. Some flexibility should be allowed so these warnings
don't appear.
    Suggested solution
Replace the concept of a presentation sector with a presentation sector range.
* video presentation sector *range* to avoid system thinking we've deviated from the frame rate too much
* iki frame presentation time is unhappy since it ends early, add a range of presentation sectors
    Effect to the user
Reduce warning that presentation sector is a frame ahead/behind

Order of published sectors is wrong in new identification pipeline (Dredd esp)
    Should instead publish a runnable that will be
    fired once all processing has bubbled up to the top
    This could also make debugging a lot easier
    without a 12 layer stack

**ROBUST FRAME RATE DETECTION**
    Background
Most videos have a pretty consistent frame rate.
Some videos seem to have a NTSC fractional offset.
Some videos have variable frame rates.
The video encoder used to make the videos uses some random logic where to place frames.
    Suggested solution
After 10 years I still don't know
Maybe there's a way by checking how much variance there is between frame lengths
Can we calculate the variance (stddev) and choose the smallest?
By PSX design, max possible frame rate is 75 or 150 fps, could always just fall back to those.
Maybe add serialized value: Precise fps:Y/N to know the difference
Maybe change the output format to something that does support variable frame rates (mkv or mov)
    Effect to the user
Better frame rates
Finish full .iki handling (UmJammer Lammy .ik2) by detecting variable frame rates

ISO9660 detection and replace
    Redo generating paths backwards
    Handle files existing beyond the end of the disc
    ! Digimon World 2 has island directory records, use them?
        -> yes with new iso9660 index design
    Replace ISO 9660 items (this gets ugly with the extra bytes at the end of a file)


Improvements
============

Java 6 Console
    Background
Java <= 5 only had stdout PrintStream, which does not allow choosing the text 
encoder (for non-English languages)
    Suggested solution
Use Java 6 Console to use proper encoding when printing to the console.

GUI improvements
    * Only show disc and index dropdown button when there are list entries
    * add double-click and arrow list
    * add keyboard actions on rows
    * Add About button
    * Add Exit button
    * Add selected count on Save All Selected button
    * Add tooltips for everything
    ? Is there a better Saving dialog design?
    * Bug: Ubuntu: only tree column is white, but text boxes have gray background
    ? Add hex viewer for files

New tabbed interface
    Add tabs, main tab still shows file structure,
    other tabs show one for each general disc item type (audio, video, pics, eventually SPU)
    Each tab will offer a "Select *" behavior, removing the current drop-down
    Each tab will offer a "Apply settings to all *", removing that (confusing) button
    Could also offer the ability to play all entries sequentially non-stop

Save/load CD name in index
    The CD name is collected during indexing, but isn't saved in the index
    Fix that

Mac
    Find better dropdown button?
        The current dropdown button works, but isn't really being used how it
        was designed. Maybe there is a better one out there.
        But any change would require extensive testing on Mac and Linux
    Experiment with other tree tables
        Java tree-tables have a long and ugly history. Maybe there is still
        another one that would be better. Still need Mac testing.
    Create mac app bundle
        Running a .jar on Mac works, but it would be cleaner if it could be
        packaged as a real application. There are ways to do it, but
        seem to require updating it for every Mac release.

New video GUI
    Includes 2 extra indicators:
        Playback position/progress
        Playback buffer capacity
    Choose scaling (100%, fit, etc.) and aspect ratio options (NTSC vs PAL)
    Change VideoPlayer into PlayerCanvas that also holds the progress bar and control buttons


Add list box when indexing that will show the items as they are discovered

* Print bs format in -static

? Make tutorial on ripping a game and using jpsxdec
? Update manual to cover game ripping

Log "Writing dup frame for frame" to user log with "to keep audio and video in sync"
Log "Ahead of reading by x frames" more like "out of sync with frame timing" maybe?
"Frame in sectors 129921-129927 is missing chunk 6" -> "Frame found in sectors x-x is incomplete or missing data"


Issues
======
! Command-line selection of parallel audio? not currently supported

[GUI, internal] Java SouceDataLine is unreliable
    Write a wrapper to fix the issues
    * Bug: audio playback position is randomly reset by SDK
    * No events are triggered when the audio buffer runs out
    Only purpose is for real-time playback
    Then can register listeners with the SourceDataLine and let those events pause the
    other components indirectly. I believe using a timer to estimate when
	the next playback hunk should end, sleeping until then,
	and check again if things are as expected,
	but also waking up to other events as well.

Serious Real-time media playback/preview issues
    Linux playback is hit-or-miss
        * OpenJDK Ubuntu video playback doesn't process frames
        * Oracle Java Ubuntu VM audio auto-starts when it shouldn't
    jPSXdec still has issues in several cases
        /?/ Bug: Audio that starts way before, ends way after, or has long breaks is not handled by player (ff tactics FFTST.STR)
        * Bug: when audio doesn't start for a prolonged period, video frame queue fills and blocks
        /?/ Bug: Player doesn't let you play movie with 1 frame
        /?/ Bug: video player repeats prior frames and audio when frame type is not detected
        * Pause video-only playback when reading is delayed
        /?/ Bug: end of playing race condition locks gui
        /?/ Bug: Player automatically plays video-only content when it is very short
        * Skip audio in the rare case it is behind sector reading
            ? Need to address static (sequential sector) audio
    ? playback audio volume?
    x I'm never going to add seeking, way too much work

Proper handling when directory box is empty
    I'm not sure if the directory box really works when empty, check that


Bug when saving: sometimes there is leftover text in Message column (race condition)

* Test on Mac

Message about applying to all types - window title "Message"
"Could not identify anything in ..." message not translated

New features
============

Games to investigate
* Star Wars - Rebel Assault II
* Discworld 2
* BrainDead 13
* Syphon Filter 3
* "Love Game's - Wai Wai Tennis [Service Price] [SLPS-01647] have intro.str file weighing 33 megabytes. In jpsxdec did not see."
* Fear Effect
* Kowloon's Gate
* Jackie Chan Stuntmaster
* Firemen 2
* Magic the Gathering
* Aconcagua ending video
// Policenauts - Video in static files

Replace
    with a prompt before applying changes
    which can be skipped with -y (don't prompt to apply changes)
    or -n (essentially a dry-run)
    * SPU
    * Add ability to replace using a PNG with (semi-)transparent pixels
    which would be painted over the original frame, then re-encoded
    x Crusader audio
    x Then introduce a shared -replace command

Editing disc items
    * SPU items samples/second varies by clip
    PSound offers the ability to choose the Hz of each, and renaming them
    * BS items don't inherently have dimensions,
    although certain ones can be inferred by the block count
    Otherwise only the user really knows what the dimensions are
    Currently an index is static
    Maybe the index should be editable and savable so the user can make these changes

Overwrite files option
    Add an option to not overwrite existing files


Add sound clip detection
    Raw data sent to the Sound Processing Unit (SPU)
    Packaged in VAG files
    PSound
    vgmtoolbox can do it?

SEQ
    vgmtoolbox can do it?

? Add CD audio detection/extraction
    ? Add CUE/TOC file parsing so the tracks can be identified

* Searching for static bitstream data

? Add option to save just 1 item allowing to specify name and location


Code improvements
=================
Create my own smaller/simpler arg parser
    The 3rd party argparser has been good, but has never really met my needs
    Implementing my own would simplify things nicely
    (some work is already done in jpsxdec.util.ArgParser)

General code stuff
    * Add unit tests to build.xml
        * Create unit test subproject?
    * Clean up all the TODOs
    * Proper handling for InterruptedExcetion
    * Cleanup IllegalArgumentException and IllegalStateExceptions
    * Findbug fixes
    * Replace package.html with package-info.java

Add @Override all the things

Logger framework that supports thread context logging - removes all the log parameters

! Cleanup Main: Remove FeedbackStream and just use a Logger
/ show error/warn unused cmdline args

* Have separate DiscItemBuilderGuiFactory to create a gui from a DiscItemBuilder and cache it
* Log when frame rate detection fails

* change xa playback to better handle static (adjacent sector) streaming
* Figure out how to better organize all the RGB and YCbCr pixel formats

? Optimize AviWriter with buffers
    - Construct audio/video chunks in ram before writing
    - Write to buffered stream

? give each disk item a little slice of the disc
    ? let that manage the start/end sectors

? More robust contextual CD sector detection
    Trying to determine what type a sector is becomes difficult when considering data corruption
    may remove the possibility of random access, unless there is smart
    limited scope contextual detection considering adjacent sectors

"Invalid Crusader header 00000000000000000000000000000000"
	Any way to check where in the stream it is?

Research

Comparisons
    ! Compare ffmpeg ycbcr->rgb to PSX ycbcr->rgb
    * Compare against PSound
    * Compare against XA audio converter http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/894/
    * Castlevania seems to have movies with lots of extra frames at the end?
    * Compare Tim against various tools out there

Replicate exact PSX color conversion - maybe impossible!
    * Reverse engineer IDCT
        Create test movies with -0.5 identity IDCT
            Place single values at various locations in the matrix
            Place two values at various locations in the matrix
    * Reverse engineer YCbCr->RGB
        Create test movies with -0.5 identity IDCT that generate predictable DC coefficients
            Add remaining Cb and Cr values

Video encoder
    ? replacement GUI preview of replace changes
    ? What to do when partial replace detects the entire frame is different
    ? create movies from scratch
    ? Include Cb/Cr un-swap correction option
      so videos decoded with other programs can be re-encoded with consistent coloring
    // remove/merge redundant MDEC codes with AC=0 (FF7)



Game specific
    * Finish testing LoD iki: GOAST.IKI (end of disc 2), DENIN2.INI (middle of disc 3), DRAGON1.IKI
    * Finish Crusader tests
        . only audio
        . starts near end
        . missing audio chunk
        . missing audio sectors
        . missing video sectors
        . missing video chunk

* double-check what the EOF and Audio-end flags mean
