/**
 * The target manager dispatches commands to {@link Targetable} objects
 * that it manages. This design of this class is based on the <i>Chain of
 * Responsiblity</i> and <i>Mediator</i> design patterns. The target manager
 * acts as a mediator between {@link TargetableAction}s and the intended targets.
 * This allows Action based components to invoke commands on components
 * without explicitly binding the user Action to the component action.
 * <p>
 * The target manager maintains a reference to a current
 * target and a target list.
 * The target list is managed using the <code>addTarget</code> and
 * <code>removeTarget</code> methods. The current target is managed using the
 * <code>setTarget</code> and <code>getTarget</code> methods.
 * <p>
 * Commands are dispatched to the Targetable objects in the <code>doCommand</code>
 * method in a well defined order. The doCommand method on the Targetable object
 * is called and if it returns true then the command has been handled and
 * command dispatching will stop. If the Targetable doCommand method returns
 * false then the
 * <p>
 * If none of the Targetable objects can handle the command then the default
 * behaviour is to retrieve an Action from the {@link javax.swing.ActionMap} of
 * the permanent focus owner with a key that matches the command key. If an
 * Action can be found then the <code>actionPerformed</code>
 * method is invoked using an <code>ActionEvent</code> that was constructed
 * using the command string.
 * <p>
 * If the Action is not found on the focus order then the ActionMaps of the ancestor
 * hierarchy of the focus owner is searched until a matching Action can be found.
 *  Finally, if none
 * of the components can handle the command then it is dispatched to the ActionMap
 * of the current Application instance.
 * <p>
 * The order of command dispatch is as follows:
 * <ul>
 *    <li>Current Targetable object invoking doCommand method
 *    <li>List order of Targetable objects invoking doCommand method
 *    <li>ActionMap entry of the permanent focus owner invoking actionPerfomed
 *    <li>ActionMap entry of the ancestor hierarchy of the permanent focus owner
 *    <li>ActionMap entry of the current Application instance
 * </ul>
