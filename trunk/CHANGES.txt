    - [Added new dialog to specify media conversion options]

v0.32 (development release)
    - Fixed decoding of Lain final movie (broke in 0.31)
    - FF9 audio decoding output is currently not working right
    - Added AVI encoding
    - Revamped the index file format somewhat (old versions no longer compatable)
    - Cleaned up some GUI behavior/looks
    - Removed GUI's ability to save anything
    Internals:
    - Changed to 'push' architechture.
    - Added FPS calculation (needed for AVI writing)
    - Adding some features for the S.E. Lain PSX Game Translation Project
    - Added ISO9660 directory parsing.
    - Added CD Mode 2 ecc/edc generation.
    - Added TIM writing.
    - Changed StrFrameUncompressorIS internals so hopefully nothing broke.
    - Added ability to re-encode STR files (StrRecompressorIS)
v0.31
    - Added a GUI! I hope it works!
    - Fixed FF8 decoding to handle audio-only 'movies'
    - Added FF9 decoding.
    - Fixed error with Audio2048 so it won't fragment certain ISO movies.
    - Improved handling of media index files.
    - Countless edits, cleaning, comments, and rearranging of code.
    - Note: index files generated by prior versions of jpsxdec may not work
            with this verion.
v0.30
    - Major internal code rearrangement.
    - Added FF8 audio decoding.
    - Removed dependencies on Java 1.6. Works now with Java 1.5.
    - Reverted YUV output to clamp at 0 and 255 (MrVacBob says analog encoding is dead).
    - Fixed YUV -> RGB green conversion (PSX uses non-standard equation), but this means that raw YUV frames outputted by jPSXdec don't follow the yuv4mpeg2 spec. 
    - Sped up video decoding when saving .demux by removing excess seeking.
    - Fixed serialzation/deserialization of STR in index.
v0.27
    - Made CD ISO image identification more flexible (although it may now just assume any file is an ISO file).
    - Fixed so it won't crash when CD audio sectors are encountered (checks to make sure all sectors are MODE2).
    - Added simple TIM file search (won't detect all TIM files in the ISO yet).
v0.26
    - Sped up video decoding by removing excess seeking.
    - Can now decode Lain final movie.
    - Added special plugins for decoding Lain SITEA.BIN SITEB.BIN LAPKS.BIN files.
    - Fixed decoding of video from ISO type files (by fixing identification of incomplete audio sectors).
    - Changed YUV output to clamp at 1 and 254 for 'sync encoding'.
    - Fixed video decoding (BufferedBitReader again)
v0.
    - Fixed video decoding (BufferedBitReader)
    - Fixed crash in CDSectorReader.java:getFilePointer() when header is not available.
