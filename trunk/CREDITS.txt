CREDITS & THANKS
----------------

The following people either helped make jPSXdec possible, or are just 
really cool (usually both): 

My dad, for everything he did for me (1949-2009).

Mike Melanson and Stuart Caie for adding STR decoding support to xine, 
including the documentation in the source. 
(http://osdir.com/ml/video.xine.devel/2003-02/msg00179.html)
Also for archiving some example STR files.
(http://osdir.com/ml/video.xine.devel/2003-02/msg00186.html)

The q-gears development team and forum members for their source code and 
documentation (http://forums.qhimm.com/index.php?topic=6473.msg81373). 
Their STR decoding source code PSXMDECDecoder.cpp was invaluable 
(http://q-gears.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/q-gears/branches/old_sources/src/common/movie/decoders/). 
Their TIM format documentation is awesome (http://wiki.qhimm.com/PSX/TIM_file)

"Everything You Have Always Wanted to Know about the Playstation But 
Were Afraid to Ask." Compiled / edited by Joshua Walker.
Perhaps the most valuable reference for any kind of PSX hacking, 
especially the PSX assembly instruction set. 

smf, developer for MAME, for figuring out that everyone was getting the 
order of CrCb wrong (http://smf.mameworld.info/?p=12).

Gabriele Gorla for clarifying to me the details of the Cb/Cr swap error,
verifying that jPSXdec is doing things right, and for
pointing out that the quantization table is uploaded to the MDEC 

Andrew Z for pursuing high quality ADPCM decoding, and verifying jPSXdec
is doing an impeccable job.

Jonathan Atkins for his open source cdxa code and documentation.

http://jonatkins.org:8080/cdxa/)

The PCSX Team, creators of one of the two open source PlayStation
emulators (http://www.pcsx.net/).
One version of its mdec.c file is particularly useful 
(http://www.google.com/codesearch?q=%22blk_zig+value%22) 

The MAME emulator team for their efforts to document and accurately
emulate hardware, and for their license (http://mamedev.org/).

Developers of the pSX emulator. While not open source, at least it is 
still under development and provides a very nice debugger for reverse 
engineering games (http://psxemulator.gazaxian.com/). 

"Fyiro", the Japanese fellow that wrote the source code for the PsxMC 
FF8 plugin. (http://homepage2.nifty.com/~mkb/PsxMC/). 

T_chan for sharing a bit of his knowledge about the FF9 format 
(http://www.network54.com/Forum/119865/thread/1196268797). 

Jen (a.k.a. punistation) for her (formally) long standing PlayStation Serial
Experiments Lain page (http://www.geocities.com/punistation10/).

Yoshitoshi ABe et al. for Serial Experiments Lain and other captivating anime.

The most excellent folks at IRCNet #lain :D

cclh12 at romhacking.net for generously providing some actual PlayStation 1
hardware RAM dumps.

Mezmorize at gshi.org for helping me get an old PlayStation and GameShark
working to make my own RAM dumps.

................................................................................
Thanks to those who wrote code that I've used at some point during development:

Alexander Strange for porting the ffmpeg simple_idct to Java.

Stephen Manley for generously sharing his DCT.java class (http://www.nyx.net/~smanley/).

Bernhard Huber for his very nice javadoc-templates
(http://members.aon.at/bhuber14/
http://plugins.netbeans.org/PluginPortal/faces/PluginDetailPage.jsp?pluginid=1168)

Doug Lea for sharing his Fraction.java class.

Sequence Point Software for the J2ME MPEG implementation of the IDCT
(http://code.seqpoint.com/j2me_mpeg/).

Eclipse SWT for the Java JPEG implementation of the IDCT.

John E. Lloyd for the handy argparser library 
(http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~lloyd/java/argparser.html). 

Joerg Anders for managing to write an mpeg1 decoder in pure Java 
(http://vsr.informatik.tu-chemnitz.de/~jan/MPEG/MPEG_Play.html).

Rodrigo Reyes for the JSmooth tool (http://jsmooth.sourceforge.net/). 

PDFJet for their PDF library.

Jerry Huxtable for his awesome ParagraphLayout.

L2Fprod for the directory chooser.

Sun for the Java platform, SwingWorker and SwingX libraries, and the Netbeans IDE.

................................................................................

Finally, a very special thanks to all the PlayStation hackers who
thought it was a good idea to keep their decoders/emulators/hacking 
tools closed source, then completely stop working on them. Extra thanks 
to those who now provide a 404 page for a web site. You sirs are real 
men of genius.
