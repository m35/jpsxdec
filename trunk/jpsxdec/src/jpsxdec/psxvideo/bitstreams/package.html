Compressed PlayStation 1 bitstream video data compression and decompression.
<p>
    The PlayStation 1 uses a video format similar to MPEG1 I-frames.
    The final step in the encoding process compresses the data into
    a stream of bits (a form of 'entropy' encoding).
</p>
<p>
    There are 4 known bitstream formats:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>{@link jpsxdec.psxvideo.bitstreams.BitStreamUncompressor_STRv2}:
        Sony developed version 2.
        Used in the majority of games. {@link jpsxdec.psxvideo.bitstreams.BiStreamUncompressor_STRv1}
        is nearly identical to STRv2, but has a couple interesting
        variations worth identifying.
    </li>
    <li>{@link jpsxdec.psxvideo.bitstreams.BitStreamUncompressor_STRv3}:
        Sony developed version 3.
        Not used very much, but provides better compression, probably
        at the cost of additional processing.</li>
    <li>{@link jpsxdec.psxvideo.bitstreams.BitStreamUncompressor_Iki}:
        .iki videos used by a few Sony games.</li>
    <li>{@link jpsxdec.psxvideo.bitstreams.BitStreamUncompressor_Lain}: 
        Used only by the Serial Experiments Lain game</li>
</ul>
