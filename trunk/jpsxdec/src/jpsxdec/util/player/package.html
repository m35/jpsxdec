    Cross-platform video/audio player.

    <p>
    You don't need the JMF to play videos.

    <p>
    The player utilizes several threads perform different tasks
    <ol>
        <li>Demuxer thread ({@link jpsxdec.util.player.AudioVideoReader})
        <li>Video processor thread ({@link jpsxdec.util.player.VideoProcessor})
        <li>Video player thread ({@link jpsxdec.util.player.VideoPlayer})
        <li>Audio player thread ({@link jpsxdec.util.player.AudioPlayer} wraps the
                         {@link javax.sound.sampled.SourceDataLine})
    </ol>
    <p>
        Audio processing is done in the demuxer thread.
    </p>
    <p>
    Packets of data are passed between these threads via
    {@link jpsxdec.util.player.ObjectPlayStream}s.

    <p>
    There is also the external Controller thread 
    ({@link jpsxdec.util.player.PlayController}) that is typically the gui.
