/**
 * Highlighter implementation which uses a Painter to decorate the component.
 * <p>
 * 
 * As Painter implementations can be mutable and Highlighters have the
 * responsibility to notify their own listeners about any changes which might
 * effect the visuals, this class provides api to install/uninstall a listener
 * to the painter, as appropriate. It takes care of Painters of type
 * AbstractHighlighter by registering a PropertyChangeListener. Subclasses might
 * override to correctly handle different types as well.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Subclasses might be implemented to change the Painter during the decoration
 * process, which must not passed-on to the Highlighter's listeners. The default
 * routing is controlled by a flag isAdjusting. This is set/reset in this
 * implementation's highlight method to ease subclass' burden (and to keep
 * backward compatibility with implementations preceding the introduction of the
 * painter listener). That is, subclasses are free to change painter properties
 * during the decoration.
 * <p>
 * 
 * As an example, a ValueBasedPainterHighlighter might safely change any painter
 * property to decorate a component depending on content.
 * 
 * <pre><code>
 * &#64;Override
 * protected Component doHighlight(Component renderer, ComponentAdapter adapter) {
 *      float end = getEndOfGradient((Number) adapter.getValue());
 *      RelativePainter painter = (RelativePainter) getPainter();
 *      painter.setXFraction(end);
 *      ((PainterAware) renderer).setPainter(painter);
 *      return renderer;
 * }
 * 
 * &#64;Override
 * protected boolean canHighlight(Component renderer, ComponentAdapter adapter) {
 *     return super.canHighlight(renderer, adapter) &&
 *        (adapter.getValue() instanceof Number);
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 * 
 * NOTE: this will change once the Painter api is stable.
