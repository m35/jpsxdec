/** This is the simplest implementation of the Inverse Discrete Cosine 
 *  Transform. If I understand correctly, it's inverse 2D DCT-II, specifically.
 *<p>
 * It's as simple as I could make it, and as such, it's about as

 * Note: Using the Stephen's version is about 13 times faster!
 * The results are almost indistinguishable. His is also likely more accurate
 * as there are fewer operations performed.
