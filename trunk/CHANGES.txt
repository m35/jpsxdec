v0.35
    - NEW SUPER FAST DECODING AVAILABLE!
    - AVI writing fixed some more.
    - Filler frames are produced for frames unable to be decoded at all
      (text of error printed on frame).
    - Added missing credits and copyrights for code from Joerg Anders's 
      MPEG player.
    - Progress window can now be closed by clicking on the X.
    - Added workaround for Java's 'All files' filter bug.
    - Fixed scaling of TIM previews in TIM saver window.
    - Fixed indexing error that can occur in some cases (because of TIM searching).
    - Added command-line -copysect and -quality options.
    - Added Chrono Cross handling for all movies on disc 2 except final movie.
    - Fixed command-line so -debug can always be used.
    Internals:
    - Pulled frame identification into its own class.
    - Changed AviWriter to uses JFIF header instead of AVI1.
v0.34
    - Command-line options changed, now nicer and uses new parsing lib
    - Cache PSXSector types in iterators for MAJOR speed increase with 
      indexing (thanks to stream change in v.33).
    - Fixed decoding of FF7 without camera data (broke in v0.32 or 0.31)
    - Added new TIM saving GUI that's real snazzy.
    - Removed yuv saving until it is re-implemented properly.
    - Added -copy and -dir command-line options.
    Internals:
    - Began adding raw CD reading for Windows.
    - Began adding new fast Java decoder (will never be fast enough for real-time).
    - Began adding a native decoder (for real-time playback someday).
    - Fixed indexing error if TIM was being searched at the end of the input file
    - Pulled the actual uncompressing/decoding out of the savers and abstracted 
      it so decoders can be interchangeable.
    - Lots of new, undocumented classes that will eventually be used for faster decoding.
v0.33 (development release)
    ! Basically all command-line decoding is disabled and needs to be re-implemented
    - Added new dialog to specify media conversion options
    - FF9 decoding working perfectly now
    - FF8 decoding working again
    - Added Chrono Cross decoding as well
    - Numerous bug-fixes and optimizations
    - STR_file_format.txt pretty much ready for 0.43 release
    - XA channels are now treated as separate media items (Saiyuki can now be decoded)
    - Again changed how some index files are saved
    Internals:
    - Cleaned up error handling during saving
    - Made all videos demuxable via the Push demuxer
    - Split up PSXSector
    - Fixed AviWriter header creation, and some other fixes
    - PsxYuv now generates its own BMP style data directly for use with AviWriter
    - Unified and cleaned up Square decoding
    - Fixed MediaHandler to handle discs with over 999 media items
    - Added more documentation, including package level docs
    - Most objects are no longer streams. They have a function to produce a stream
      of the data. This has many advantages:
      + Able to create multiple streams of the same data (necessary for multiple listeners of the data)
      + Duplicating very little data for each stream (just indexes)
      + Making a sub-stream of a stream is again very easy (just duplicate indexes)
      + I suppose this breaks up the code to be a little more modular
      + It uses more of well tested java classes, so less jpsxdec code, and more reliable
      + Implements the read(byte[]) for faster bulk reading.
v0.32 (development release)
    - Fixed decoding of Lain final movie (broke in 0.31)
    - FF9 audio decoding output is not working right (output is almost correct, 
      but still has an error) and video isn't re-implemented yet.
    - FF8 video decoding isn't re-implemented yet.
    - Added AVI encoding
    - Revamped the index file format somewhat (old versions no longer compatible)
    - Cleaned up some GUI behavior/looks
    - Removed GUI's ability to save anything (need to re-implement)
    - Saving TIM files is broken in some cases (in Main.java)
    - STR_file_format.txt FF9 section is work-in-progress (lots of extra junk in there)
    Internals:
    - Changed to 'push' architecture.
    - Added FPS calculation (needed for AVI writing)
    - Adding some features for the S.E. Lain PSX Game Translation Project
    - Added ISO9660 directory parsing.
    - Added CD Mode 2 error correction (ecc/edc) generation.
    - Added TIM writing.
    - Changed StrFrameUncompressorIS internals (for StrRecompressorIS) so hopefully nothing broke.
    - Added ability to re-encode STR files (StrDiffCombine.java and StrRecompressorIS.java). 
      Still need to handle case when recompressed frame is too big to fit.
v0.31
    - Added a GUI! I hope it works!
    - Fixed FF8 decoding to handle audio-only 'movies'
    - Added FF9 decoding.
    - Fixed error with Audio2048 so it won't fragment certain ISO movies.
    - Improved handling of media index files.
    - Countless edits, cleaning, comments, and rearranging of code.
    - Note: index files generated by prior versions of jpsxdec may not work
            with this version.
v0.30
    - Major internal code rearrangement.
    - Added FF8 audio decoding.
    - Removed dependencies on Java 1.6. Works now with Java 1.5.
    - Reverted YUV output to clamp at 0 and 255 (MrVacBob says analog encoding is dead).
    - Fixed YUV -> RGB green conversion (PSX uses non-standard equation), but this means that raw YUV frames outputted by jPSXdec don't follow the yuv4mpeg2 spec. 
    - Sped up video decoding when saving .demux by removing excess seeking.
    - Fixed serialzation/deserialization of STR in index.
v0.27
    - Made CD ISO image identification more flexible (although it may now just assume any file is an ISO file).
    - Fixed so it won't crash when CD audio sectors are encountered (checks to make sure all sectors are MODE2).
    - Added simple TIM file search (won't detect all TIM files in the ISO yet).
v0.26
    - Sped up video decoding by removing excess seeking.
    - Can now decode Lain final movie.
    - Added special plugins for decoding Lain SITEA.BIN SITEB.BIN LAPKS.BIN files.
    - Fixed decoding of video from ISO type files (by fixing identification of incomplete audio sectors).
    - Changed YUV output to clamp at 1 and 254 for 'sync encoding'.
    - Fixed video decoding (BufferedBitReader again)
v0.
    - Fixed video decoding (BufferedBitReader)
    - Fixed crash in CDSectorReader.java:getFilePointer() when header is not available.
