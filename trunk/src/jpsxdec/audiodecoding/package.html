        Classes for decoding Playstation ADPCM audio into PCM audio.
        <p>
            These classes can be broken up into 3 categories:
        </p>
        <h4>Decoders</h4>
        <p>
            {@link jpsxdec.audiodecoding.StrADPCMDecoder} and
            {@link jpsxdec.audiodecoding.SquareADPCMDecoder} perform
            the main decoding task. {@link jpsxdec.audiodecoding.StrADPCMDecoder}
            handles the standard STR and XA audio format.
            {@link jpsxdec.audiodecoding.SquareADPCMDecoder} handles
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_Co">Square</a>'s
            own unique audio format found in a number of their games.
            Audio data should be passed in to their <code>DecodeMore()</code>
            function, along with 1 or 2 
            {@link jpsxdec.audiodecoding.ADPCMDecodingContext}s.
        </p>
        <h4>Pull Demuxer Decoder InputStreams</h4>
        <p>
            This long-winded descrption accurately describes what
            {@link jpsxdec.audiodecoding.StrAudioPullDemuxerDecoderIS} and
            {@link jpsxdec.audiodecoding.SquareAudioPullDemuxerDecoderIS} do.
            They 'pull' the audio data from an iterator, demux it, and decode it to
            PCM data. All this is done only as the classes' InputStream interface is
            being read from.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that these classes were used in early stages of jpsxdec, 
            but are no longer. They remain here as simple examples of how to decode
            audio.
