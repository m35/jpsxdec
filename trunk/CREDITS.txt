CREDITS & THANKS
----------------

The following people either helped make jPSXdec possible, or are just really cool people (usually both):

Mike Melanson and Stuart Caie for adding STR decoding support to xine, including the documentation in the source. (http://osdir.com/ml/video.xine.devel/2003-02/msg00179.html) Also for archiving some example STR files (http://osdir.com/ml/video.xine.devel/2003-02/msg00186.html).

The q-gears development team for their forums, source code, and documentation (http://forums.qhimm.com/index.php?topic=6473.msg81373). Their STR decoding source code PSXMDECDecoder.cpp was invaluable (http://q-gears.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/q-gears/trunk/src/common/movie/decoders/).

"Everything You Have Always Wanted to Know about the Playstation But Were Afraid to Ask." compiled / edited by Joshua Walker. Even if it has the CrCb reversal error, it will always be a great reference for PSX hacking.

smf, developer for MAME, for figuring out that everyone was getting the order of CrCb wrong (http://smf.mameworld.info/?m=200603).

Jonathan Atkins for his open source cdxa code and documentation (http://freshmeat.net/projects/cdxa/  http://jcatki.no-ip.org:8080/cdxa/  http://jonatkins.org:8080/cdxa/).

The PCSX Team, creators of one of the two open source Playstation emulators (http://www.pcsx.net/). This version of their mdec.c file is particularly useful http://www.koders.com/c/fidF23C1EAFCEAF84CA539927A01093D37D9695722A.aspx

Developers of the pSX emulator. While not open source, at least it is still under active development, and provides a very nice debugger for reverse engineering games (http://psxemulator.gazaxian.com/).

"Fyiro", the Japanese fellow that wrote the source code for the PsxMC FF8 plugin. (http://homepage2.nifty.com/~mkb/PsxMC/).

T_chan for sharing a bit of his knowledge about the FF9 format (http://www.network54.com/Forum/119865/thread/1196268797/last-1197023290/Final+Fantasy+9+Format).

Stephen Manley for generously sharing his DCT.java class (http://www.nyx.net/~smanley/)

Steve Purcell et al. for the handy jargs library (http://jargs.sourceforge.net/).

Joerg Anders for managing to write an mpeg1 decoder in pure Java (http://vsr.informatik.tu-chemnitz.de/~jan/MPEG/MPEG_Play.html). His IDCT is being utilized.

Rodrigo Reyes for the JSmooth tool (http://jsmooth.sourceforge.net/).

Jen (a.k.a. punistation) for her long standing Playstation Serial Experiments Lain page (http://www.geocities.com/punistation10/).

Yoshitoshi ABe et al. for Serial Experiments Lain and other captivating anime.   

The most excellent folks at IRCNet #lain :D


Finally, a very special thanks to all the Playstation hackers who thought it was a good idea to keep their decoders/emulators/hacking tools closed source, then completely stop working on them. Extra thanks to those who now provide a 404 page for a web site. You sirs, are real men of genius.
