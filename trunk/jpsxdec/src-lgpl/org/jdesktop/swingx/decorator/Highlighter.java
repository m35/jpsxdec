/**
 * <code>Highlighter</code> provide a mechanism to modify visual attributes of
 * cell rendering components. The mechanism is uniform across both rendered and
 * rendering component types: it is the same for SwingX collection views
 * (JXTable, JXList, JXTree/Table) and independent of the concrete component
 * type used for rendering the cell. The view cell state is factored into a
 * <code>ComponentAdapter</code>.
 * <p>
 * 
 * For example, in data visualization components that support multiple columns
 * with potentially different types of data, a <code>ColorHighlighter</code>
 * imparts the same background color consistently across <em>all</em> columns
 * of the rendered component regardless of the actual cell renderer registered
 * for any specific column.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The highlightable properties are basically defined by the renderer in use:
 * only attributes the renderer guarantees to reset on every call are safe to
 * alter. For SwingX renderering support these are listed in
 * <code>ComponentProvider</code>.
 * 
 * 
 * Implementations supporting mutable internal state which effects the
 * decoration must notify its listeners about the change. Typically, the
 * rendered component installs a listener to its <code>Highlighter</code>s
 * and triggeres a repaint on notification.
